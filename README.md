##About

A stealth/action survival platformer made for the WGD 2 week spooky compo, whereby you play as a human survivor attempting to escape a space station where something has gone horribly wrong; experiments are roaming everywhere and even the darkness hides death.

##Features

- Stealth/action gameplay; avoid, hide, or shoot enemies to progress through
- Character creation with customiseable colors
- Fully fledged UI
- Basic enemy detection system
- Static and dynamic lighting (lights vs flashlight)
- Entity systems such as elevators, buttons, doors, ladders, chests, hiding spots and more
- Light detection system whereby evil apparitions hunt you if you stay in the dark for too long
- Two fully fledged levels created with the Ogmo level editor
